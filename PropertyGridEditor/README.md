# PropertyGridControl

I couldn't find a easy way to make a data grid look good AND have the ability to have multiple different controls in a column.
so i made one.

This control uses a grid, and creates and places the UI controls like textbox, Comboboxes, and checkboxs to the screen.
There is also a obserableDictionary that is used to "bind" the properties you create/Add with your C# code!

TODO:
N columns

Here's an example!
